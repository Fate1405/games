# games

A collection of possibly the most scuffed games on the internet (by me)

**NB: Most of the assets used are not mine and just found on the internet somewhere. For this reason, no license will be granted to use and/or distribute the projects** (idk why anyone would even want to).

Below find a short description of each game.

## Pongjs

The best first game for anyone to make with a new game engine is Pong. I utilised Phaserjs as it is the best engine available for any JavaScript programmer who thinks they're far too cool for Python.


## Pongpy

Tail between my legs, I came back to Python to relish the dearly missed OOP and barebones nature that the Pygame game engine provides. Unfortunately, it couldn't save me from my own ineptitude.
