# games

A collection of possibly the most scuffed games on the internet (by me)

**NB: Most of the assets used are not mine and just found on the internet somewhere. For this reason, no license will be granted to use and/or distribute the projects** (idk why anyone would even want to).

Below find a short description of each game.

## Pongjs

The best first game for anyone to make with a new game engine is Pong. I utilised Phaserjs as it is the best engine available for any JavaScript programmer who thinks they're far too cool for Python.


## Pongpy

Tail between my legs, I came back to Python to relish the dearly missed OOP and barebones nature that the Pygame game engine provides. Unfortunately, it couldn't save me from my own ineptitude.


## Tic Tac Toe

This is the classic noughts and crosses game made in pygame. This took longer than expected as I initially attempted to create the entire game utilising solely a functional paradigm before realising this was Python and OOP was inescapable. However, apart from a few gross violations of DRY, I believe that the code written is reasonable scalable to a game with a bigger board perhaps or more players.
